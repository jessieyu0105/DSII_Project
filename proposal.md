Project Title
-------------

A Predictive Model for Life Expentancy using Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) Data

Motivation
----------

Average life expectancy is a general health measure stating average lifespan for a given area,

To build predictive models for average life expectancy, and isolate the best possible option.

Anticipated Data Source
-----------------------

[Community Health Status Indicators (CHSI) to Combat Obesity, Heart Disease and Cancer, from Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://healthdata.gov/dataset/community-health-status-indicators-chsi-combat-obesity-heart-disease-and-cancer)

Response(s) and predictors
--------------------------

Planned analyses
----------------

1.  Data exploration: descriptive and visualization

2.  Variable reduction using Principle Component Analysis

3.  Model building

-   Odinary Least Squares model: using stepwise regression / best subsets regression

-   Ridge regression

-   Lasso

-   Principal components regression (PCR)

-   Partial least squares (PLS) regression

1.  Use k-folds Cross Validation to determine the best model
